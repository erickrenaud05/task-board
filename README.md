# TASK BOARD

## Description

This page is used to display all the tasks the user inserts. All tasks are displayed in three columns. To-do, inProgress and done, you can move the task from column to column by simply drag and dropping to the column of your choice. The background color of each task is based on the due date of the task. The task cards hold the title of the task, followed by the description of your task, followed by the due date and then a delete button. Find a screenshot of the webpage here: [task-board](task-board-ss.jpeg).

## Usage 

To use the website, follow this link: https://erickrenaud05.github.io/task-board. Once you are on the website, there is only one button to press initially, that is the add task button in green. Click this button and fill out the form, if for any reason you would like to abandon the form, simply click the x in the top right corner of the form of the big grey button that reads "close" or simply click anywhere other than the form. Submit the form by pressing the green add task button. If successful, the form will leave the screen and the page will refresh with your new task on the board. The tasks are saved to localStorage. If you try to submit the form with missing fields, the form will NOT leave and you will be given a message that all fields must be completed. If you wish to delete a task for any reason, press the delete button on the task you wish to delete, you will be prompted with a confirmation request. Press ok if you wish to delete or cancel if you wish to keep the task.
